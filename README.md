# This is Spring app CRM REST CLIENT.We also have in our repository app spring-crm-rest-api-db.These are 2 separated apps that communicate together, to retrieve data from the database.In application. properties file we have URL from our CRM REST API.We also created 2 JAVA CONFIG CLASSES, because we are using PURE JAVA CONFIG, NO XML.Controller and Customer classes are the same as before.We just have different SERVICE LAYER which have task to communicate with CRM REST API on the SERVER SIDE.On that way CRM REST CLIENT and CRM REST API works together.We was using objest RestTemplate who provides us executing http request methods, exposing REST API what we made.In this SERVICE LAYER we created all CRUD methods.
